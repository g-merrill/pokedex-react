# Pokedex Project

During the last unit of the cohort we'll be building an in class app in conjunction with the each day's lessons. Here is the progression we'll take with this application.

Make sure to run `npm install` in the project directory to install the packages included in the starter code.

Take a minute to tour the starting code including the `json` file with our starter data.
